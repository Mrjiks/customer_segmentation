# Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics, such as demographics, behaviors, and purchase histories. The primary goal of customer segmentation is to identify high-yield segmentsâ€”those groups of customers that are likely to be the most profitable or have significant growth potential. By understanding these segments, businesses can develop targeted strategies to cater to the specific needs and preferences of each group, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and increasing overall profitability.

In this project, I utilized SQL to extract and analyze data from the customer_seg table. This table contains comprehensive information about customers, including:

1 user_id: A unique identifier for each customer.
2 gender: The gender of the customer.
3 age: The age of the customer.
4 salary: The salary of the customer.
5 purchase_history: A binary indicator (1 or 0) showing whether the customer has made a purchase.
6 date: The date associated with the purchase history.

By examining these attributes, I was able to segment customers based on their demographics and purchasing behavior. This analysis provided insights into which segments are most valuable and allowed for the development of targeted marketing and sales strategies. For instance, understanding the relationship between age and purchase frequency can help tailor promotional offers, while analyzing salary data can aid in creating premium product lines for higher-income segments.

Overall, the application of customer segmentation in this project demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in improving business outcomes and fostering customer loyalty.
